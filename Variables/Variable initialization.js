/*
Variable declaration and initialization
1. Create several variables using different letter cases and beginning characters. Check if they still exist if you refer to them in different case - does case matter here? Try to declare a variable starting with number as the first character.
*/

var num1 = '3';
var num2 = '5';
var Num3 = '10';
var 3num = 'broj';

console.log(3num)

//A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


/*
2. Save a string (text) describing your current mood in a variable and print it out in console.
*/

var mood = 'radoznala'
console.log(mood)


//3. Feel free to play around in the console and get familiar with it.
